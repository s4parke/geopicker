# GeoPicker
Sometimes the default geocode isn't good enough. This utility allows you to fine tune the latitude/longitude fields after your geocode independent of the address. Try it by typing in an address, then moving the marker after it zooms to it.

Note that it was written for use in [Knack](http://knackhq.com), an application builder. To reuse it you'll want to switch out the textbox detection methods to match your HTML.
